In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while Linux libc, a fork  of
glibc  1.x  created by Linux developers who felt that glibc development
at the time was not sufficing for the needs of Linux.  Often, this  li‐
brary  was  referred  to  (ambiguously) as just "libc".  Linux libc re‐
leased major versions 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as many minor versions of
those  releases.  Linux libc4 was the last version to use the a.out bi‐
nary format, and the first version to provide  (primitive)  shared  li‐
brary  support.   Linux libc 5 was the first version to support the ELF
binary format; this version used the shared library  soname  libc.so.5.
For  a  while, Linux libc was the standard C library in many Linux dis‐
tributions.

However, notwithstanding the original motivations of the Linux libc ef‐
fort,  by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in 1997), it was clearly su‐
perior to Linux libc, and all major Linux distributions that  had  been
using  Linux  libc soon switched back to glibc.  To avoid any confusion
with Linux libc versions, glibc 2.0 and later used the  shared  library
soname libc.so.6.

Since  the  switch from Linux libc to glibc 2.0 occurred long ago, man-
pages no longer takes care to document Linux libc  details.   Neverthe‐
less,  the  history  is  visible in vestiges of information about Linux
libc that remain in a few manual pages, in  particular,  references  to
libc4 and libc5.
